# My Block Counts!

## environmental data collection app built with React Typescript, Node, and Sequelize  
#

***This project is currently on pause due to external obligations, and I hope to be able to continue to expand and improve it soon.***

Built for the University of Maryland, this is the open source codebase of an app by which users can, via a convenient and navigable UI, submit detailed environmental data on specific city or town blocks to a central database.

The next step in this project is to expand the data visualization and manipulation UI to include sorting and filtering.

As significant updates of this application are released, so to will the public codebase be updated.
